Insulated panels help with comfort and energy savings.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Professional renovations also include upgraded wiring, plumbing (for utility sinks), and ventilation if needed. These upgrades turn a cold garage into a cozy, usable space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Garage Renovation Costs and Budget Planning<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You don\u2019t need to break the bank to upgrade your garage.
